Random points to consider later:


- Second agent to be portrayed as greyed out cells to act as drop off / starting areas.

- Simultaneous Activation vs Random Activation could be good to flip between the two for path finding implementations.

- Read example final reports and see if should be writing report alongside project.

- Research into how shortest path algorithms are used in a grid. Develop a shortest path algorithm example blue start red goal green search

- Look into how to change click behaviour with Mesa

- Look into how to change grid position on page

- Click interaction with Mesa

- Add bias to try and make the robots travel in the most straight lines they can efficently.

Implemented - At the moment hard limit on number of cells in the grid based on the number of grocery items. Make variable I.E 1 item type can be in multiple bins.
