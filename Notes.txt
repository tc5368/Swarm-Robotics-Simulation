Random points to consider later:



Implemeneted - Robots being called to get outstanding items.

Not needed - Robots put excess items back where they are from

Add allocation to give the robot the location to pick the next item up from.

Add graphing to show the number of items moved

Add sliders to the visulisation for the input settings

Implemented - Change the pickup item part to instead check if is an item is needed before picking it up.

Implemented - Setup allowing robots to pickup and drop off items.

Implemeneted - Fix orders, where there are less cells than possible grocery items then some orders will be impossible as might need items not anywhere in the grid.

Implemented - Third agent to be portrayed as greyed out cells to act as drop off / starting areas.

- Non traversable areas, I.E coloumns

Implemented - Basic Implemented for random - Stop allowing robots to enter the same space as one another.

- Simultaneous Activation vs Random Activation could be good to flip between the two for path finding implementations.

- Read example final reports and see if should be writing report alongside project.

- Research into how shortest path algorithms are used in a grid. Develop a shortest path algorithm example blue start red goal green search

Implemented - Look into how to change click behaviour with Mesa

Not pheasable - Look into how to change grid position on page

Implemented as hover over - Click interaction with Mesa

- Add bias to try and make the robots travel in the most straight lines they can efficently.

Implemented - At the moment hard limit on number of cells in the grid based on the number of grocery items. Make variable I.E 1 item type can be in multiple bins.

- Review: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4565

- Idea, Robots whose job it is to retock bins, not realistic as normally the bins go 25 containers deep and can be filled from the bottom.
